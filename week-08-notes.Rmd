# 08-01: Data Types Exploration

## 08-01-00 Part II - Semi-Structured and Unstructured Data

+ Corporate data changing over time - stuff that's going on right now

    + any data that can help the corporation succeed and be profitable
    + historical, real-time, reports/analysis, forecasts, prediction data
    + traditional business environment - data has been easy to gather, especially Transactional

Structured Data vs. Unstructured Data

![](changing_data_formats.png)

+ Unstructured

    + don't know what's going to be in an email
        + always know what's going to be in a purchase order
        + email only needs a to: and from:. Everything else is up to the sender
    + 80% of enterprise data 
        + 20% of enterprise data is structured
        
+ Semi-structured & Unstructured data

    + Data solutions
        + MongoDB - document based data management solution
        + Hadoop - foundational software used for Big Data (unstructured) 
    + Queries
        + PowerBI Desktop
            + Getting data
            + Wrangle data
            + Visualizations
            + Skills transferrable to Tableau
            + Focus on **Data Query**
        + SSMS
        + Some native Mongo
      
## Data Types

+ Data Repositories

    + Database (for structured data)
        + Collections of data sets stored in a systematic way (properly controlled and structured)
        + Document Store
        + Data Warehouse
        + Data Mart
    + Data Lake (for unstructured data)
        + Big storage area that receives all kinds of data in their native format
        + Usually at high-velocity, from a variety of sources
        
+ Types of Data

    1. Structured (Relational)
        + Rigid schema-based, for rows and columns
    2. Semi-structured (NoSQL)
        + Self-describing or schema-less
    3. Unstructured (Big Data)
        + Multiple, unknown, or changing structure
        + This is where it gets FUN!

## Structured Data

+ Schema-based, relational databases

    + Traditional business databases
    + Known and maintained format
    + Products, sales, inventory, warehouse
    + Must understand data in order to do anything with it
    + pre-determined how the data should be structured
    + known and maintained format

+ Requires a database management system

    + heavyweight, server-based systems, hosted to cloud
    + Controls all access and data integrity
        + gatekeeper - prevents bad things from happening to the data
    + Fast and scale upward
    + Very rigid, expensive, and difficult to change
    + SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL

## Semi-Structured Data

+ Schema-less, Dynamic schema, NoSQL

    + NoSQL <- Not Only SQL
        + Can be relational, have rules, have security and governance
        + doesn't have to be SQL based
    + Types
        + self-describing documents
        + Graphs
        + key-values
    + Mobile and web applications
    + Facebook, OneNote, EverNote
        + Facebook:
            + mobile device connects to Facebook and queries the data to display on feed
            + DBMS is not deployed on personal devices
            + basically a localized DB is brought to your phone related to your particular FB account
        + Online banking:
            + works by using secure document of information
            + application can read the document and pull information
        + All data is stored as documents and application must know how to access and interact with the data for your specific account
    + DBMS not always required
        + lightweight, mobile
        + works across platforms and devices
        + places data logic and integrity on the application
        + places data logic and integrity on the application
            + security can be a concern
            + applications could vary and cause problems
        + Frameworks: JSON, MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra
            + Framework <- DBMS
            + Frameworks <- concepts and rules rather than a DBMS
        + must be able to transfer data via semi-structured data
        + app updates:
            + functionality, bugs, enhancements
            + reflect changes that they're pushing into data structure
            + Facebook implementing emotional reactions to 'likes'
            + "Everything from this point forward will have 1/5 different emotions" 
        + DBMS does all controls <- structured
        + application does all controls (access to data and do things properly) <- semi-structured
        + write the applications to recognize old data vs new data
  
+ Semi-structured data (self-describing documents)

    + repeats name of columns each time there's a data element
    + insert new columns that have different field names 
    + possible to convert a relational table into a self-describing document
    + possible to read a self-describing document to build a relational table
    
+ Graph data

    + understanding relationship between items (people/machines/products/etc.)
    
## Unstructured Data (Big Data)

+ Unknown schema or definition

    + **All data has some kind of structure** <- EXAM
    + But we may not know the structure or control it
    + structure varies

+ Can be pretty much any kind of data

    + sensor data
    + social media posts - the format is known in-house to read the data
    + video/audio
    + binary
    
+ Unstructured data

    + requires sophisticated tools
        + Hadoop, HBase, Google BIg QUery, Dynamo DB
        + **Often uses Data Lakes** - EXAM
        + heavy-weight tools that are scalable and high-speed
        + specially designed programming tools and skills
        
+ **Big Data Characteristics** - EXAM

    + big data meets any 1 or combination of these V's
    + Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability
        + Volume - large quantity of data
            + things are big
            + lots of data, like video streaming
        + Velocity - high-speed
            + banking - purchase something and get notification on phone before you even walk out the store
            + autonomous driving cars - sensors receiving huge amounts of data to base its decisions on
        + Variety - data of different types
            + data lake scenario - data of a lot of different types
            + logistics company for deliveries
        + Variability - lack of consistency in data
            + weather machine sensors - lots of weather data but format is inconsistent
    + Data Lake - selective of what goes in lake
        + only things that will potentially be valuable to us in the future
        
+ **Parallel processing is key to Big Data Processing** - EXAM

    + ability to do things with multiple computers at the same time
    + reason why things have changed so rapidly in the last 10 years
    + rather than scaling up 1 computer to be bigger, better, faster, scale out multiple computers to spread the workload

## Technical Environment

+ virtual desktop
+ access to MongoDB Atlas
+ Query Tools

    + SSMS
    + Power BI
    + Excel
    + Azure Data Studio (class-platform)
        + https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15 


# NoSQL Overview, Part 1

## 08-02-01 NoSQL Databases

+ What is NoSQL?

    + Does NOT Mean: No SQL
        + They actually have SQL features
    + Does NOT mean: Non-relational
        + You can store relational data
    + Means: Not-only-SQL
        + Which means it stores MORE than relational data
        + Can store unstructured data
        + Can store various structures
        + **Multi-modal data stores** <- stores multiple types of data structures all in the same DB, and not need multiple systems to get the work done - EXAM

+ NoSQL Evolution
    
    + Developed in late 2000s
        + as storage costs dramatically decreased
        + "how do we store data"
    + all information about a customer is stored in a document within a collection
    + collection <- table
    + document <- row
    + NoSQL - doesn't need to join tables to pull necessary data
    + Focused on: - EXAM
        + **multi-purpose** (multiple data types in same collection and being able to reference it all at the same time)
        + **Flexibility** (iterate quickly, releasing new features)
            + adding additional fields without having to modify a schema
            + applications must be able to recognize new data structure
        + **fast queries** (data accessed together lives together)
        + **programming language** (agnostic)
        + **horizontal scaling and replication** (low-cost)
            + SQL Server wants to sit on a single server
                + if scaling up, must put database on bigger better faster stronger server
            + NoSQL scales horizontally - buy another machine and distribute processing and data between multiple machines
        + **distributed data** (geographic-specific sharding)
        
+ SQL vs. NoSQL

![](SQLvsNoSQL.png)
    
## NoSQL Data Types

+ **Key-Value** <- large amounts with simple lookup
    
    + there's a key and there's a value that goes along with the key
    + good with large amounts of data to do simple lookups

+ **Document** <- general purpose
    
    + relational or non-relational

+ **Wide-column** - large amounts predictable query patterns

    + meant for data warehouse, data mart
    + like storing historical data
    + high speed queries, aggregations, etc.
    
+ **Graph** <- storing and analyzing relationships between data

+ Key-Value 

    + Simple data storage format (locker)
        + Every item is stored as a key
            + with its value
            + values can vary in size and type
        + All queries return a single value
    + Cons
        + does not use joins
        + no indexing on values
        + no querying on values
        + not for complex data
    + Applications
        + online gaming site that shows top 10 players
        + dictionary (word is key, definition is value)
    + Products
        + redis cache, riak, voldemort, cosmos db
    + **in order to get anything out of a key-value DB, need to know the keys**
        + query key-value structure 

## Document Data Type

+ document data != SQL data
+ the way we organize data is different between the two 
+ Document

    + Database consists of
        + "Collection" of "Documents"
            + "Table" of "Rows"
    + Documents: 
        + Are complex data structures
        + can contain different data structures
        + can contain nested documents
    + Objectives
        + rather than separating data (like in SQL), we group it together
            + Common data is grouped together
            + Even if some data is repeated
        + speed and ease of use replaces data integrity
        + high-speed queries
            + Through sophisticated indexing
            + defined links between data elements
        + the whole concept of documents enables you to index anything within a structure
        + squiggly brackets - {} indicates an entire document
            + field names with key-value pairs
            + fields can contain arrays
            + fields can contain an array of sub-documents
            
+ Document - Sub-document

    + Data structures within data structures
    + be mindful of the commas!
    
![](document-sub-document.png)

+ Document - Data Linking

    + using documents with relationship to organize how the information is stored
    + not used much in document DBs
        + typically used to break up personal sensitive data to beef up security

![](document-data-linking.png)

+ Relational Database vs. Document Database

    + Relational
        + Rows and columns
    + Document
        + Multiple documents within a collection
    + Details depended on the product for relevance and avoid columns that have a bunch of Null's
    + **You must know the schema that you're using to maintain consistency in order to do cross document queries** - EXAM
        + must spell 'tags' consistently
        + Requires diligence

+ Document Applications

    + Uses
        + same as most SQL databases
        + Beneficial for: 
            + Variable data elements
            + changing data elements
            + distributed data applications
    + Products
        + MongoDB
        + Cassandra

## Wide-Column Data Type

+ Wide-Column

    + Stored data together as Column Family Store
        + Column oriented, rather than rows (SQL)
        + Column families are groups of related data
            + often accessed together
            + Can be of varying data types
        + Optimized for large scale queries
            + not for individual row-lookups
            + not optimized for joins
    + Stored together as **column families** - EXAM
        + Rows do NOT have to contain all data columns
        + rows can contain millions of columns
        + New columns can be added easily
        + Extremely scalable
    + For data identification:
        **+ Row ID
        + Column Family 
        + Column Name
        + Timestame** - EXAM
        
+ Data Model

    + Rows
        + Unique ID
    + Columns
        + Grouped in Column Families (CF)
        + Variable columns
        + Variable data types
        + Consistent naming
            + CF's
            + Columns
            
+ "Wide Column" due to Column Families

    + typically have hundreds of rows

# NoSQL Overview, Part 2

## Graph Data Type

+ Graph

    + Data format
    + Method for connecting multiple data points through various relationship
    
+ Graphs

    + **Symmetric** (Hierarchical)
    + **Asymmetric**
        + Social media
        + sales, equipment performance, etc.
        + Vertices
        + Edges
        + Direction
        + Correlation analysis to investigate causality
        
+ Graph Queries

    + Types of questions
        + specific connections
        + relationship between 2 points (vertices)
        + Shortest distance between 2 points
            + degrees of separation
        + shared interests
            + collaborative filtering
    + Products:
        + Neo4J, HyperGraphDB, MongoDB, SQL Server
      
## No SQL v SQL DBMS

+ Compared to SQL

    + Data Manipulation (ACID)
    + Security
    + Scaling
    + Disaster Recovery
    + Data Distribution
    
+ SQL - ACID Conditions

    + **Atomicity** - guarantees each transaction is a single unit, unaffected by other transactions
        + not as important in NoSQL
    + **Consistency** - guarantees that a transaction follows all the rules or won't be applied
    + **Isolation** - guarantees transaction happen sequentially, rather than at the same time
        + not as important in NoSQL
    + **Durability** - guarantees once a transaction is committed it remains, regardless of system failure
    
+ NoSQL - CAP Theorem

    + **Consistency** - every node in the cluster returns the same, most recent write
        + stuff will be written
    + **Availability** - every node returns a responses for all read and write requests in a reasonable amount of time
        + SQL = 'durability'
    + **Partition Tolerant** - the system continues to function and uphold consistency across network partitions
        + it can fix itself...like Wolverine!
        
+ Security
    
    + Varies by product
        + some have enterprise-level offerings
        + encryption at rest
        + encryption in transit
    + Traffic cop that owns the keys to the vault and only allows the approved people to access

## Scaling and Replication

+ SQL scales up - need bigger, better, faster, stronger servers! 

    + Avoid upgrades - buy a bigger server to fit needs of the future
    + High-availability
        + Synchronous replicas ($$$)
            + must be written before main server continues receiving transactions (synchornous replica of PROD)
            + backup replica to PROD that will step in if main server fails
    + Recovery
        + Asynchronous replicas
            + does not need to be written before main server continues receiving transactions
    
+ NoSQL scales in clusters

    + add more rather than rip and replace with bigger, better, faster, stronger
    + cluster <- commodity low-cost servers
    + distributed computing capability is the advantage of NoSQL over SQL databases
        + leads to 'parallel processing'!
    + all requests go through the Router
    + Router <- traffic cop that sends queries to the appropriate data storage and server to get result sets
    + High-availability Cluster
        + Synchronous replicas
        + hot spares sitting there with nothing on it yet
        + this seems like the greek monster that Hercules fights with the multiple heads that grow back 2 after 1 being cut off
    + Recovery Cluster
        + Asynchronous replicas
        + doesn't need to mimic PROD until needed
    

## Distributed Data - Sharding

+ Sharding

    + ability to separate data into physical collections
        + not replicating, but distributing data
        + reduces query workload on any one server
        + improves response time to local users
        + optimizes data location, based on demand
            + online retail sales
            + online multiplayer gaming sites
            + real estate housing sites
        + chunk out the data so that it can be queried intelligently
    + it's like Infinity Stone shards!

    + specify how the DB engine finds outputs to queries

# MongoDB Query

## MQL Query Basics

+ SQL Server vs. MongoDB 

    + unable to add values into tables with invalid IDs
    + Document DB's, you can because no foreign keys

![](sqlvsmql.png)

+ SQL Server

    + Databases
    + Tables
    + Rows

+ MongoDB 

    + Databases
    + Collections
    + Documents
    
+ MQL 

    + Not the same as SQL
        + JOINs are not available
        + Documents have the necessary data - no JOINs needed!
        + Connecting to other collections is possible
            + Requires extra steps using $lookup()
    + 2 basic query methods synonymous with SELECT
        + db.collection.find() <- this is a SELECT statement
        + db.collection.aggregate() <- for calculations
    + **Can never go wrong with a double quote "key": value**
        
+ Query Example - AirBnb

    + Documents always have an '_id' key and always the first field
    + important to know what the *expected* value should be
    
+ Queries

    + 'List the documents'
    + SQL
        SELECT * 
        FROM listingsAndReviews;
    + MQL
        db.getCollection("listingsAndReview").find({})
        # start with table, then find the fields
        # empty curly brackets means SELECT *
    + 'List the URL and number of beds fields'
    + MQL
        db.getCollection("listingsAndReviews").find(
          {listing_url: 1, beds: 1});
        # colon (:) 1 <- include this data
        # : 0 <- show me everything in this schema EXCEPT for anything with __: 0
    + Either querying to find all fields or excluding all fields
        + cannot mix and match

+ Queries - Project
    
    db.getCollection(listingsANdReviews").aggregate(
      {$project: {listing_url: 1, beds: 1}});
    # I want to project this list of fields
        

+ Queries - Filter

    + List the URL and number of beds fields for entries with 2 bedrooms
    + MQL
        db.getCollection("listingsAndReviews").find(
          {bedrooms: {eq:2}},
          {listing_url: 1, beds: 1});
          
    + Beware of equal default! 
        + {bedrooms: {$eq:2}} <- same as {$filter:{bedrooms:2}}
        
    + Aggregate
         db.getCollection("listingsAndReviews").aggregate(
          {$filter: {bedrooms: 2}},
          {$project:{listing_url: 1, beds: 1}});
          
+ Query - Sort

## Select Fields

+ .find() - Fields

    + Method fo including or excluding fields in a query result (aka result set)
        + be careful to avoid filter set
        + reference subdocument fields
        + expand array and subdocument elements
    + find() assumes things

## Distinct()

+ .distinct()
    
    + provides a list of unique results
        + as an array rather than a row
    + for a single field only
        + in quotes
    + field name always goes in quotes ""
    
    db.getCollection("listingsAndReviews").distinct(
    "amenities")
    
## Sort Results

+ .sort()

    + a method for sorting results of a query
    + ascending (1) and descending (-1)
    + difficult to do multiple clause sorting
    + not enough RAM (memory) to do multiple sorts
